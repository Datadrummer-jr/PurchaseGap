About Datapyme Datapyme is a data science project that seeks to illuminate the complex economic landscape of contemporary Cuba through the lens of programming and applied analytics. Its primary focus is to examine how fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies shape the pricing strategies of Cuban MIPYMES (micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises) and MLC (freely convertible currency) stores. By systematically comparing local price dynamics with global benchmarks, the project uncovers patterns of inflation, market adaptation, and strategic shifts in consumer accessibility.

Beyond the dollar, Datapyme extends its scope to analyze the broader behavior of foreign exchange in Cuba, exploring how multiple currencies interact with local economic structures and influence everyday transactions. This multidimensional approach allows for a deeper understanding of Cuba’s pursuit of economic autonomy, the resilience of its enterprises, and the challenges posed by global market pressures.

Ultimately, Datapyme is not only a technical exercise in programming and data science but also a strategic exploration of how data-driven insights can reveal the hidden mechanisms of economic survival, adaptation, and independence. It aims to provide valuable knowledge for students, researchers, and entrepreneurs interested in the intersection of technology, economics, and social transformation.
